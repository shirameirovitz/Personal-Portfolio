    <h3 id="headline">Official Standard of the Belgian Malinois</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><b>General Appearance-</b> The Belgian Malinois is a well balanced, square dog, elegant in
appearance with an exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck. The dog is strong, agile,
         well muscled, alert, and full of life.</li>
       <li><b>Size, Proportion, Substance:</b> Males are 24 to 26 inches in height; females are 22 to 24 inches;
measurement to be taken at the withers. Males under 23 inches or over 27 inches and females
         under 21 inches or over 25 inches are to be disqualified</li>
       <li><b>Forequarters-</b> The forequarters are muscular without excessive bulkiness. The shoulder is long
and oblique, laid flat against the body, forming a sharp angle with the upper arm. The legs are
straight, strong, and parallel to each other. The bone is oval rather than round. Length and
substance are well in proportion to the size of the dog. The pastern is of medium length, strong,
and very slightly sloped. Dewclaws may be removed. The feet are round (cat footed) and well

padded with the toes curved close together. The nails are strong and black except that they may
         be white to match white toe tips.</li>
       <li><b>Color-</b> The basic coloring is a rich fawn to mahogany, with black tips on the hairs giving an
overlay appearance. The mask and ears are black. The underparts of the body, tail and breeches
are lighter fawn, but washed-out fawn color on the body is a fault. Color should be considered a
finishing point, not to take precedence over structure or temperament. The tips of the toes may be
white, and a small white spot on the breastbone/prosternum is permitted, not to extend to the
         neck</li>
       <li><b>Temperament-</b> Correct temperament is essential to the working character of the Belgian
Malinois. The breed is confident, exhibiting neither shyness nor aggressiveness in new
situations. The dog may be reserved with strangers but is affectionate with his own people. He is
naturally protective of his owner's person and property without being overly aggressive. The
Belgian Malinois possesses a strong desire to work and is quick and responsive to commands
         from his owner. Faulty temperament is strongly penalized.</li>
